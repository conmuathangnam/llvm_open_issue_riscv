#ifndef	_FEATURES_H
#define	_FEATURES_H	1

/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _ISOC2X_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C2X.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__
			ISO C2X interfaces defined only in Annex F.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE_SOURCE Select correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

/* C99 7.18.1.1 Exact-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.1.2 Minimum-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.1.3 Fastest minimum-width integer types.
 *
 * The standard requires that exact-width type be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-, and
 * 64-bit types if they are implemented. Other exact width types are optional.
 * This implementation defines an exact-width types for every integer width
 * that is represented in the standard integer types.
 *
 * The standard also requires minimum-width types be defined for 8-, 16-, 32-,
 * and 64-bit widths regardless of whether there are corresponding exact-width
 * types.
 *
 * To accommodate targets that are missing types that are exactly 8, 16, 32, or
 * 64 bits wide, this implementation takes an approach of cascading
 * redefinitions, redefining __int_leastN_t to successively smaller exact-width
 * types. It is therefore important that the types are defined in order of
 * descending widths.
 *
 * We currently assume that the minimum-width types and the fastest
 * minimum-width types are the same. This is allowed by the standard, but is
 * suboptimal.
 *
 * In violation of the standard, some targets do not implement a type that is
 * wide enough to represent all of the required widths (8-, 16-, 32-, 64-bit).
 * To accommodate these targets, a required minimum-width type is only
 * defined if there exists an exact-width type of equal or greater width.

/* C99 7.18.2.1 Limits of exact-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.2.2 Limits of minimum-width integer types.
 * C99 7.18.2.3 Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types.
 *
 * The presence of limit macros are completely optional in C99.  This
 * implementation defines limits for all of the types (exact- and
 * minimum-width) that it defines above, using the limits of the minimum-width
 * type for any types that do not have exact-width representations.
 *
 * As in the type definitions, this section takes an approach of
 * successive-shrinking to determine which limits to use for the standard (8,
 * 16, 32, 64) bit widths when they don't have exact representations. It is
 * therefore important that the definitions be kept in order of decending
 * widths.
 *
 * Note that C++ should not check __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS here, contrary to the
 * claims of the C standard (see C++ 18.3.1p2, [cstdint.syn]).

   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__), while a few features from TS
   18661-1 are not included in C2X (and thus should depend on
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__ even when C2X features are
   enabled).

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT) controls those features from TS
   18661-1 not included in C2X.

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT_C2X) controls those features from TS
   18661-1 that are also included in C2X (with no feature test macro
   required in C2X).

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_EXT) controls those features from TS 18661-1
   that are included in C2X but conditional on
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__.  (There are currently no features
   conditional on __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__ that are not in TS
   18661-1.)  */

 * headers both include stddef.h When SM.A builds, __STDDEF_H will be defined.
 * When SM.B builds, the definition from SM.A will leak when building without
 * local submodule visibility. stddef.h wouldn't include __stddef_null.h, and
 * SM.B wouldn't import _Builtin_stddef.null, and SM.B's `export *` wouldn't
 * export NULL as expected. When building with modules, always include
